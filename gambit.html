    <p>Yea...<br>
    Not going to lie, this game I was trying to make was just NOT working with me.  Everything I tried to do,
    another 4 things will break and I would have to spend hours doing research to figure out what I can do to fix it.<br>
    So... I gave up.<br>
    If you want to see what I managed to make so far, you can click the picture to the right.</p>
